# 3D-cube-rotation
c++ code on 3d cube rotation
For this first you have to install 'glut' library in your codeblocks or vs code. you can download it through internet and see few video on youtube on how to make it work in codeblock or vs code. then make a project and write the given code .
you can change the speed of rotation by changing the value in line number 72 i.e (alpha = alpha + .03;) if you increase the value of .03 then the speed increases.
i have provided most of the usecase of the function as comments so hope you have a clear view of it.
